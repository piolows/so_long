# So_long - 42
So_long project from the 42 cursus.

This project uses MiniLibX, a library of functions which can be used to create a simple GUI. This library and its functions have quite limited capabilities but we're able to make some very interesting programs with it nonetheless.

So_long is a 2D game in which the player must collect all collectibles available in the map and exit the map with the least amount of moves possible. Using MLX functions, we can display images on screen and take input from the user. MLX simply puts images on screen, but by taking user input and smartly placing images appropriately, we can simulate having objects on screen which seem to directly react to input.

Project completed on February 24 2024 with bonus (125/100).
